It was a very cold winter morning when Simon realised.
His music collection was gone!
He started looking in the attic
then he heard a strange sound
it reminded him of a song he had heard in his youth
it came from a cracking old radio
My journey to get to this office 
I take the dlr from this station to bank
Then change and take the district
